# Example on the drug response data:
This file contains of the programs to run the Drug Response example from McLain and Zgodic (2022).  The main file to use is 

“Drug Response Example.R”

This script contains the programs to repeat the analysis for all methods except the Conformal Jackknife and Empirical Bayes approaches which were ran separately (see “Drug_example_conform_jack.R” and "Drug_example_EBreg.R" for the code).  The results to all analyses were combined and saved “Drug_results_full.rds”.  

To summarize the results and make the graphs see the file

“Summarizing and plotting results.R”

Which will load in the .rds files and create the summarizations and graphs presented in the McLain and Zgodic (2022).
