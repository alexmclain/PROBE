Description: This package contains functions to fit an efficient and powerful Bayesian approach for sparse high-dimensional linear regression. Unlike previous approaches, our model formulation is focused on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the regression coefficients with minimal prior assumptions on the parameters. Plug-in empirical Bayes estimates of all hyperparameters are used. Efficient estimation is completed through the use of a partitioned and extended expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm which is similar to a combination of an Estimation Conditional Maximization (ECM) and a parameter expanded (PX) EM algorithm. The result is a PaRtitiOned empirical Bayes Ecm (PROBE) algorithm applied to sparse high-dimensional linear regression. We give functions to estimate credible and prediction intervals for predictions of future values.
