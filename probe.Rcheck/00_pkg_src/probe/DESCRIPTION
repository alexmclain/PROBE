Description: This package contains functions to fit an efficient and powerful Bayesian approach for sparse high-dimensional linear regression. Unlike previous approaches, our model formulation is focused on maximum \eqn{a posteriori} probability (MAP) estimation of the prior mean of the regression coefficients which have a traditional spike-and-slab form. Minimal prior assumptions on the parameters are required through the use of plug-in empirical Bayes estimates of hyperparameters. Efficient estimation is completed through the use of a partitioned and extended expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm. The result is a PaRtitiOned empirical Bayes Ecm (PROBE) algorithm applied to sparse high-dimensional linear regression. We give functions to estimate credible and prediction intervals for predictions of future values.
